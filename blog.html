      Second Order Cone Programming is a powerful tool. This convex optimization problem has the form:

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>"Love all things beautiful." These were the words of my dad as he would teach me mathematics and physics, the former usually within the context of the latter, and for good measure he would somehow throw a Confucius quote in there. And so I naturally was drawn towards these fields during all of my formative years. Middle school, high school, my early college career. Days were filled with AP classes, where I would learn about derivatives, ellipses, and classical mechanics. When I went home, I eargerly phoned my dad, who I saw less and less as he was always travelling for work, and he would give me further insight, almost condescendingly explaining how the topics that I was studying are simplifications of more general theories, how classical physics is a simple derivative of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks. I would then do the problem sets assigned for homework, and work through the "Problem Solving" sections in my calculus book, anxious to go to math club the next day to share what I learned. I came into college, and took Math H54, honors linear algebra, and was left in the dust by the prodigies in that class. I took Physics 7B, as I intended to major in Physics, I became nauseated by the idea of taking another ring integral. 61A, computer science, was really the only class I enjoyed. So since that freshman year first semester, I have had to reformulate the "objective function" of my life. "The world runs on practicality and innovation, not Lagrange multipliers", my friend would always tell me. And so I figured it was time to become more practical. As my junior year rolled around, I was still extremely impractical, opting to sip on some coffee and read my Optimization textbook on a Sunday morning instead of applying for internships. So I started to panic, I needed to show employers that I wasn't just a high level abstractionist who can only type up problem sets in LaTex. So when Cal Hacks, a hack a thon organized by UC Berkeley, came around, I told myself that I was going to go and show employers that Ray can code. And wow that was 36 hours of suffering. Our team did win the best VR hack, and it was fun to learn about Unity3D/C#, but during the hack a thon there was always in the back of my mind "go study for your midterm". I once read a blog post by Andrej Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla, about undergraduate advice, and it went something along the lines of "The strongest students do just well enough in their classes to get around the 80% percentile, and spend the rest of their time exploring other technologies." And so here I am today, frantically applying to internships, getting rejected by near all of them. I still love to study what I love, but knowing how to adapt and be practical is perhaps even more important.</p>
