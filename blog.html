      Came into Berkeley as a physics major, took 7B, and decided I never wanted to take a ring integral again. Below are some thoughts on the classes that I took over my 4 years here. 
      <ul>
        <li>Fall 2019</li>
        <ul>
          <li>CS186: Databases</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Logistically amazing.</li>
            <li>Consensus is that the difficulty/workload has increased significantly with respect to years prior. For example, for the multigranularity locking homework, I believe that previous semesters did not have to implement nearly as much functionality.</li>
            <li>SQL, data wrangling, attention to detail.</li>
            <li>Found the multigranularity locking, recovery, entitry relationship models, functional dependency parts to be the most interesting. Testing and reading codebases was helpful as well.</li>
            <li>Took with Prof. Hellerstein and Lakshya Jain</li>
          </ul>
          <li>STAT153: Time Series</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Mantra of the course: Remove trend and seasonality by subtracting it from the time series. The remaining time series should be "stationary", and you fit a model to that stationary time series, namely, ARIMA.</li>
            <li>In general, statistics courses not as logistically streamlined as CS courses.</li>
            <li>Took with Jared Fisher, GSI Johnny Hong.</li>
            <li>Nature of the content was more conducive to slide decks as opposed to blackboards. I like blackboard lectures better. R code demos very helpful.</li>
            <li>Took this course to learn how to predict stock prices, and go "back to the basics". </li>
          </ul>
          <li>STAT155: Game Theory</li>
          <ul>
            <li>3 Unit elective type course. Mostly stat 3rd/4th years, 1st year grad students.</li>
            <li>Took the course because I read about Noam Brown's Libratus poker bot that used Counterfactual Regret Minimzation. While 155 doesn't touch on that specifically, it does go over the fundamentals.</li>
            <li>Prof. Stoyanov does blackboard lectures.</li>
            <li>Somewhat somber, many of Berkeley's game theory researches, Papadimitriou, Yuval Peres, left for Columbia and Microsoft Research, respectively.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Spring 2019</li>
        <ul>
          <li>EE120: Signal Processing</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Babak Ayazifar. Fourier transforms and the Nyquist rate.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>CS162: Operating Systems</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Kubiatowicz. Not much to say. Toughest course I took here. Projects were massive. Material tedious and dry.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>CS375: Teaching Techniques in CS, uGSI'd for CS70</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Pedagogy course. Learned a lot while teaching discussion sections. Fun to talk with the course staff about math. Prof. Rao is nice.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Fall 2018</li>
        <ul>
          <li>CS189: Machine Learning</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Yu, Recht, Hardt. Recht did most of the foundations, Yu did the PCA, </li>
          </ul>
          <li>EECS127: Optimization</li>
          <ul>
            <li>El Ghaoui and Bayen accents' made the entire course.</li>
          </ul>

          </ul>
          <li>EECS126: Probability Theory and Random Processes</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Really soldifies one's understanding of probability after CS70. Kalman filtering, orderstatistics, Erdos-Renyi random graphs.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>CS174: Discrete Probability and Combinatorics</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Class should be renamed to randomized algorithms. While the first few lectures were spent on discrete probability and combinatorics, the rest of the course was all on randomized algorithms.</li>

        <li>Fall 2017</li>
        <ul>
          <li>CS170: Algorithms</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fun class, great textbook. Spent a lot of time doing the problem sets, which occasionally had really tricky problems. 4-part proofs for algorithms forces you to write out your ideas carefully.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>This class was ok, didn't really understand a lot of the concepts and lectures were meh. I've been told the course notes are really good but I didn't feel the same way.</li>

<p>There I was, on a foggy Tuesday Bay Area morning, halfway through the Fall semester of 2018, sitting in Li Ka Shing 105 lecture hall, steaming hot coffee in left hand, notebook propped on the miniscule armchair desk on my right, pen at the ready. It was 9:08, class had not yet started, consistent with the Cal tradition of classes starting 10 minutes after the hour. Attendance was spotty, especially considering the fact that the lecture would not be posted online later. There were only about 40 people in the room. 500 were enrolled in the course. This was CS189, Introduction to Machine Learning, a class that was notorious in the CS department for its mathematical rigor and conceptual difficulty. It was halfway through the semester, and I thoroughly loved the course. Learning in lecture the theoretical underpinnings behind Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Singular Value Decomposition, it’s as if I was peering into the soul of the universe. In afternoon discussion section, a graduate student would walk us through step by step the derivation of Kernel Ridge Regression, explaining all the subtleties along the way. At night, study groups convened and toiled at the pages and pages of problem sets. And if we weren’t too tired, we would get started on implementing the coding part of the homework, learning PyTorch and CUDA, each group hoping that their Residual Neural Network had the lowest misclassification rate. This class could easily be a 30 hour per week ordeal, and I enjoyed every second of it. Each concept in lecture was like a screwdriver added to my toolbelt. I felt like Thanos in that lecture hall, slowly but surely collecting each infinity stone on my path to world domination. </p>
<p>Everything changed on that Tuesday morning though. Professor Moritz Hardt walks in, wheeling his full carbon fiber bicycle, and plugs in his powerpoint: “Fairness in Machine Learning”. What? The first slide reads: “DO NOT SHARE THESE SLIDES”. My grip on my pen loosens. The lecture went over the human impact that AI can have, ranging from a racist beauty pageant, to a facist twitter bot, to fatal self-driven Tesla crashes. The main case study though, was an algorithm to predict recidivism rates in inmates. Recidivism is when a former inmate commits a crime again, returning to prison. However, the issue was that this algorithm seemed to label African Americans a higher risk of recidivism compared to Caucasians. So the AI optimist might ask, what if African Americans really did have a higher recidivism rate? But the study showed that if we condition on both inmates not recidivating, then the algorithm still would label the African American inmate as a higher recidivism risk. This was the bottom line. The second that you involve humans, the model must be evaluated as if humans mattered. There are a number of criterion that describes the “fairness” of an ML/AI algorithm that is the topic of much research today. But as I walked out of the lecture hall with my friend, I was confused. Where was the math? I know I sure as heck can’t import scipy and call scipy.linalg.fairness() on my model. That day changed my perspective on ML. I even went as far as emailing professor Hardt about how one should understand fairness, because it surely wasn’t as clean as Linear Regression. His response was enlightening: “I strongly believe that ML is not about techniques. It's about concepts. I'm sure you could learn kNN or XGBoost in an hour. But the point of 189 is so that you understand how to think about the input and outputs to those methods. Hope you enjoyed the class.” You could go out there and learn every statistical learning algorithm there is, and that would probably make you an expert, but I have since started to balance the “nitty gritty” with the “big picture”, dissecting the algebra, but also spending time to dwell more on the effects of implementing a certain model. </p>
<p>The second and final experience that has significantly shaped my perspective of AI/ML is my current research experience. I am an undergraduate researcher at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science, working to speed up the MRI acquisition process. How MRI works is by generating a magnetic field using a metal coil. The coil will excite the hydrogen atoms in our body, and that is what is measured, the spin of the hydrogen atoms. Currently, the classical techniques that have worked reasonably well requires finding a sparse signal domain that captures most of the information in the signal, and then using this to undersample during scanning. In short, classical techniques entails solving an optimization problem, one that ideally has a clean solution. That way, scans can be sped up, which is especially beneficial for infants. The different approach we are taking is using Recurrent Neural Networks in order to exploit the temporal features of MRI scan acquisition. The idea behind Recurrent Neural Networks is that they have memory, which aligns with the time dependent process of MRI. Performing this research had a steep learning curve though. Installing packages, learning the C development stack, getting familiar with the Bridges Supercomputer environment, and managing Anaconda environments, along with the 1Tb+ of data was new to me. No matter how well I “understood the concepts” or could recreate the theory and calculations outlined in papers, nothing else matters if the model doesn’t run because your GPU ran out of memory! </p>
<p>ML/AI is an extremely diverse field, with many applications. One cannot just “understand the concepts” but not know how to put models into use, and one cannot just be a master at training models but unable to modify the code when a change in the inputs arrives. A balance must be achieved. Take neural networks for example. It is easy to get overly optimistic at the advances in speech recognition and computer vision, as it is widely understood that these ideas have been in place for decades. The reason for their current success is due to the advancements in hardware. This makes it easy for elitists and purists to overgeneralize. Take my convex optimization professor for example, I can’t tell you how many times he has said: “Neural Networks is just nonlinear optimization!”, or “ML is just backpropagation!”. While there is a lot of truth in these sentiments, there is are a lot of shortcomings in a completely theoretical treatment of Neural Networks. Some empirical results are just unexplainable with current technologies. </p>
<p>The future of AI is a balancing act. In order for the field to advance, there must be theoretical models developed that push the feasibility of modern technology. But there also must be an industry standard foundation for models that involve humans, with fairness and safety being the foremost issues. This will certainly be a challenge, and perhaps even impossible with all the proprietary codebases. But to maintain progress in this exciting technology, there must be a balance. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Computer systems must be able to act reliably under the stress of incorrect information.</li>
        <li>A. All loyal generals must decide upon the same plan of action.</li>
        <li>B. A small number of traitors cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad plan.</li>
        <li>$v(i)$ is the information communicated by general $i$, and $v(0),v(1),...$ is used by each general to generate a decision.</li>
        <li>1. Every loyal general must obtain the same information $v(1),...,v(n)$</li>
        <li>2. If the $i$th general is loyal, then the value he sends must be used by every loyal general as the value of $v(i)$.</li>
        <li>1'. Any two loyal generals use the same value of $v(i)$.</li>
        <li>The problem statment: A commanding general must send an order to $n-1$ lieutenant generals such that:</li>
        <li>IC1. All loyal generals obey the same order.</li>
        <li>IC2. If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant obeys the order he sends.</li>
        <img src="bgp_imposs.png" style="width:50%">
        <li>Apparently, the above reasoning is not rigorous enough to show that $\leq 3m+1$ generals cannot deal with $m$ traitors.</li>
        <li>Proof by contradiction: Assume that there is a solution for a group of $3m$ or fewer generals, and use it to construct a solution to the three general BGP, which has been shown to be impossible.</li>
        <li>Assumed solution is Albanian generals, the constructed solution is BGP.</li>
        <li>Start with $3m$ Albanian generals that can handle $m$ traitors, and construct a solution that solves 3BGP.</li>
        <li>Here's how it's done: Have each Byzantine general simulate approx $\frac{1}{3}$ of the Albanian generals.</li>
        <li>Each Byzantine general is simulating at most $m$ Albanian generals. The Byzantine commander simulates the Albanian commander plus at most $m-1$ Albanian lieutenants. Each of the two Byz generals simulate at most $m$ Alb generals.</li>
        <li>IC1 and IC2 are satisfied.</li>
        <li>IC1'. All loyal lieutenants attack within 10 minutes of one another.</li>
        <li>IC2'. If the commanding general is loyal, then every loyal lieutenant attacks within 10 minutes of the time given in the commander's order.</li>
        <li>Commander sends attack order by sending 1:00, and sends an retreat order by sending 2:00.</li>
        <li>(1) After receiveing the attack time from the commander, a lieutenant does one of the following: (a) If the time is 1:10 or earlier, then attack. (b) If the time is 1:50 or later, then retreat. Otherwise continue to step (2).</li>
        <li>(2) Ask the other lieutenant what he did in step (1). (a), if the lieutenant made a decision, then make the same decision he did. (b) Otherwise, retreat.</li>
        <li>A solution with oral messages: We define a solution that works with $m$ traitors, and $3m+1$ generals.</li>
        <li>A1. Every message that is sent is delivered correctly.</li>
        <li>A2. The receiver of a message knows who sent it.</li>
        <li>A3. The absence of a message can be detected.</li>
        <li>Note that here, intergeneral communication is possible. This is not necessarily the case.</li>
        <li>If a traitor decides not to send a message, we set the other generals to interpret this as RETREAT by default.</li>
        <li>Algorithm $OM(0)$. <br>
          (1) The commander sends his value to every lieutenant. <br>
          (2) Each lieutenant uses the value he receives from the commander, or uses the value
RETREAT if he receives no value.</li>
        <li>Algorithm $OM(m), m > O$. <br>
(1) The commander sends his value to every lieutenant. <br>
(2) For each $i$, let $v_i$ be the value Lieutenant $i$ receives from the commander, or else be 
RETREAT if he receives no value. Lieutenant $i$ acts as the commander in Algorithm
$OM(m - 1)$ to send the value $v_i$ to each of the $n - 2$ other lieutenants. <br>
(3) For each $i$, and each $j \neq i$, let $v_j$ be the value Lieutenant $i$ received from Lieutenant $j$
in step (2) (using Algorithm $OM(m - 1))$, or else RETREAT if he received no such
value. Lieutenant $i$ uses the value $majority(v_1,...,v_{n-1})$.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Can you explain how confidentiality, integrity, and availability relate to software security vulnerabilities?
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              These three concepts are central to cybersecurity, and is known as the AIC triad. These three will guide an organization in how it handles information security. Confidentiality limits the access of information, integrity ensures that the information is trustworth and accurate, and availability is the consistent reliable access of this information by authorized people. 
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Confidentiality is privacy. We need to ensure that only authorized people get access to data, and that data is categorized into the impact that a compromise of the data would have. To that end, we would use social engineering, strong passwords. Encryption, two factor authentication, biometric authentication, key fobs, soft tokens, air gapped computers, hard copies only. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be altered during transit, especially by malicious actors. File permissions, access control, and version controls are all means to this end. Version control, cryptographic checksums are to ensure that chance events such as EMP and server crashes are detected and accounted for. Backups are redundancies are used to limit the adverse effect of such events.
              </li>
              <li>
                Availability is maintained by keeping hardware up to date, performing regular inspections, and ensure there are no software concurrency issues. All software updates should be current. Bandwidth and bottleneck reduction are pinnnacle. Redundancy, failover, RAID, and high-availability clusters can help mitigate adverse effects. Firewalls and proxy servers can defend against DoS attacks. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Big data, such as when Edward Snowden revealed that the federal government was tracking American's personal information. IoT, because of the gathering of data from almost anywhere, can be conglomerated to reveal sensitive information. IoT networks can be hacked into becoming a botnet. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>What is the same origin policy? What does it protect against in web browsers?</li>

            The domain of the HTML page defines all elements on it. When resources from different domains are allowed to modify the current DOM tree and access the current site, then that would be unsafe. A resource an only access another pages resources if they both come from the same origin.

        <li>What is cross-site scripting (XSS)? Why is it useful for attackers? How can a web application defend against it?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            XSS is the injection of JS code into another website, so that when loaded, Same Origin Policy will not detect that it came from the same domain, and allow for the script complete access to all resources. To protect against this, we need to sanitize inputs. This restricts what resources can be accessed from scripts. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is cross-site request forgery (CSRF)? Why is it useful for attackers? How can a web application defend against it?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSRF happens in authenticated sessions when the server trusts the user/browser, while XSS doesn't need an authenticated session and only requries that the website does not validate and escape input. For example, if we are logged into a banking site while surfing Facebook, and accidentally click a malicious link that does a bank transfer, the server will think that the request was valid. However, to solve this, the web server could ask for all requests to append a supplied token to the end of all requests.

        </ul>
        <li>Are black lists or white lists preferential?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            White lists are preferential, as they are less resource intensive than black lists. Furthermore, it is better to have the default be not allowing for access. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>How can a security team help developers write secure code?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open and established security mechanisms should be used, do not reinvent the wheel! The underlying mechanism of a system should be kept as simple as possible, and designs should be modularized. Complete mediation ensures that each access to every process must be authenticated first. Fail safe defaults ensures that by default, access is restricted. Separation of priviledge tells us that two requirements or more must be satisfied in order for access to be granted. Least priviledge tells us that we should give each part of the software the most restricted set of priviledges possible. Least common mechanism tells us that tools common to more than one program should not be shared. Psychological acceptability tells us that easy to use mechanisms that are easy to accept will be safer. Complementary security and defense in depth tells us to have multiple different contingencies to support not allow for a single failure to compromise the entire system.

        <li>What kinds of security activities can a security team undertake with a development team? What are the pros and cons of each? (ex: penetration testing, threat modeling, etc..)</li>

            Yeah I don't really know this one.

      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      Second Order Cone Programming is a powerful tool. This convex optimization problem has the form:
      $$\text{min}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} c^Tx \\ 
      \text{s.t. } \|A_ix+b_i\|_2 \leq c_i^Tx+d_i$$
      There are many optimization problems that can be reduced to this general form, but the punchline is, we now allow for constraints involving the norm of $x$, a step up from the linear constraints that we required in LPs, and QPs. But it is not obvious why SOCPs are more "general" than QCQPs, which have the form:
      $$\text{min}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} x^TH_0x+2c_0^Tx+d_0 \\ 
      \text{s.t. } x^TH_ix+2c_i^Tx+d_i \leq 0 \\
      x^TH_jx+2c_j^Tx+d_j = 0$$
      Can't we just square the inequality constraint in our SOCP, such that it can be massaged into a QCQP? This is not the case, because in general, it is invalid to square constraints of the form $\|x\| \leq k$. So SOCP is at least as general as QCQP. 


      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      What is a cone? The definition of a cone is any set $\mathcal{S}$ that satisfies the property that $s \in \mathcal{S} \Rightarrow \alpha s \in \mathcal{S}, \alpha \geq 0$. There are all types of different cones that topologists love to study, but we will look at the "norm cone" with respect to a norm $\|*\|$:
      $$\mathcal{C}=\{(x,t), \|x\| \leq t\} \subseteq \mathcal{R}^{n+1}$$ 
      We mathematically define an $(n+1)$ dimensional Second Order Cone as follows:
      $$\mathcal{K}_n=\{(x,t),x \in \mathbb{R}^n, t \in \mathbb{R}: \|x\|_2 \leq t\}$$
      Here, we see the meaning of the name "Second Order" cone, as it is a norm cone using the $\mathcal{l}_2$ norm. Another equivalent definition of the $(n+1)$ second order cone is the intersection of an infinite number of half spaces:
      $$\mathcal{k}_n=\bigcap_{u:\|u\| \leq 1}\{(x,t), x \in \mathbb{R}^n, t \in \mathbb{R} : x^Tu \leq t\}$$



      <h4>Geometry</h4>
      We now introduce a constraint known as a hyperbolic constraint:
      $$\|x\|_2^2 \leq 2yz, y \geq 0, z \geq 0, \text{where: } x \in \mathbb{R}^n, y \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \mathbb{R}$$
      Then, we claim that this constraint is exactly equivalent to the Second Order Cone constraint:
      $$\|\begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y-z)
      \end{bmatrix}\|_2 \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y+z)$$
      which can be verified algebraically. What we have just done is converted hyperbolic constraints into SOC constraints. However, if we inspect the resulting SOC constraint, and reverse engineer it, we see that:
      $$\begin{bmatrix}
      I_n & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
      0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y \\
      x \\
      \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y-z) \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y+z)
      \end{bmatrix} 
      $$
      The matrix on the left is a rotation matrix in the $y,z$ plane of 45 degrees clockwise. Hyperbolic constraints are equivalent to a funny looking SOC constraint, which is equivalent to actually just an SOC, "toppled" to the ground, or formally speaking, rotated! And so this is where we get the notion of a rotated SOC. We start with an SOC, apply to it a rotation matrix, and realize that the result is equivalent to a hyperbolic constraint. How neat!

      <p>"Strive for beauty and elegance." These were the words of my dad as he would teach me mathematics and physics, the former usually within the context of the latter, and for good measure he would somehow throw a Confucius quote in there. And so I naturally was drawn towards these fields during all of my formative years. Middle school, high school, my early college career. Days were filled with AP classes, where I would learn about derivatives, ellipses, and classical mechanics. When I went home, I eargerly phoned my dad, who I saw less and less as he was always travelling for work, and he would give me further insight, almost condescendingly explaining how the topics that I was studying are simplifications of more general theories, how classical physics is a simple derivative of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks. I would then do the problem sets assigned for homework, and work through the "Problem Solving" sections in my calculus book, anxious to go to math club the next day to share what I learned. I came into college, and took Math H54, honors linear algebra, and was left in the dust by the prodigies in that class. I took Physics 7B, as I intended to major in Physics, I became nauseated by the idea of taking another ring integral. 61A, computer science, was really the only class I enjoyed. So since that freshman year first semester, I have had to reformulate the "objective function" of my life. "The world runs on practicality and innovation, not Lagrange multipliers", my friend would always tell me. And so I figured it was time to become more practical. As my junior year rolled around, I was still extremely impractical, opting to sip on some coffee and read my Optimization textbook on a Sunday morning instead of applying for internships. So I started to panic, I needed to show employers that I wasn't just a high level abstractionist who can only type up problem sets in LaTex. So when Cal Hacks, a hack a thon organized by UC Berkeley, came around, I told myself that I was going to go and show employers that Ray can code. And wow that was 36 hours of suffering. Our team did win the best VR hack, and it was fun to learn about Unity3D/C#, but during the hack a thon there was always in the back of my mind "go study for your midterm". I once read a blog post by Andrej Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla, about undergraduate advice, and it went something along the lines of "The strongest students do just well enough in their classes to get around the 80% percentile, and spend the rest of their time exploring other technologies." And so here I am today, frantically applying to internships, getting rejected by near all of them. I still love to study what I love, but knowing how to adapt and be practical is perhaps even more important.</p>
