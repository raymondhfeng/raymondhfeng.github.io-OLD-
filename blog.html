      <ul>
        <li>
          Can you explain how confidentiality, integrity, and availability relate to software security vulnerabilities?
        </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              These three concepts are central to cybersecurity, and is known as the AIC triad. These three will guide an organization in how it handles information security. Confidentiality limits the access of information, integrity ensures that the information is trustworth and accurate, and availability is the consistent reliable access of this information by authorized people. 
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Confidentiality is privacy. We need to ensure that only authorized people get access to data, and that data is categorized into the impact that a compromise of the data would have. To that end, we would use social engineering, strong passwords. Encryption, two factor authentication, biometric authentication, key fobs, soft tokens, air gapped computers, hard copies only. 
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrity involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire life cycle. Data must not be altered during transit, especially by malicious actors. File permissions, access control, and version controls are all means to this end. Version control, cryptographic checksums are to ensure that chance events such as EMP and server crashes are detected and accounted for. Backups are redundancies are used to limit the adverse effect of such events.
              </li>
              <li>
                Availability is maintained by keeping hardware up to date, performing regular inspections, and ensure there are no software concurrency issues. All software updates should be current. Bandwidth and bottleneck reduction are pinnnacle. Redundancy, failover, RAID, and high-availability clusters can help mitigate adverse effects. Firewalls and proxy servers can defend against DoS attacks. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Big data, such as when Edward Snowden revealed that the federal government was tracking American's personal information. IoT, because of the gathering of data from almost anywhere, can be conglomerated to reveal sensitive information. IoT networks can be hacked into becoming a botnet. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        <li>What is the same origin policy? What does it protect against in web browsers?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The domain of the HTML page defines all elements on it. When resources from different domains are allowed to modify the current DOM tree and access the current site, then that would be unsafe. A resource an only access another pages resources if they both come from the same origin. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is cross-site scripting (XSS)? Why is it useful for attackers? How can a web application defend against it?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            XSS is the injection of JS code into another website, so that when loaded, Same Origin Policy will not detect that it came from the same domain, and allow for the script complete access to all resources. To protect against this, we need to sanitize inputs. This restricts what resources can be accessed from scripts. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is cross-site request forgery (CSRF)? Why is it useful for attackers? How can a web application defend against it?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            CSRF happens in authenticated sessions when the server trusts the user/browser, while XSS doesn't need an authenticated session and only requries that the website does not validate and escape input. For example, if we are logged into a banking site while surfing Facebook, and accidentally click a malicious link that does a bank transfer, the server will think that the request was valid. However, to solve this, the web server could ask for all requests to append a supplied token to the end of all requests. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Are black lists or white lists preferential?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            White lists are preferential, as they are less resource intensive than black lists. Furthermore, it is better to have the default be not allowing for access. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>How can a security team help developers write secure code?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open and established security mechanisms should be used, do not reinvent the wheel! The underlying mechanism of a system should be kept as simple as possible, and designs should be modularized. Complete mediation ensures that each access to every process must be authenticated first. Fail safe defaults ensures that by default, access is restricted. Separation of priviledge tells us that two requirements or more must be satisfied in order for access to be granted. Least priviledge tells us that we should give each part of the software the most restricted set of priviledges possible. Least common mechanism tells us that tools common to more than one program should not be shared. Psychological acceptability tells us that easy to use mechanisms that are easy to accept will be safer. Complementary security and defense in depth tells us to have multiple different contingencies to support not allow for a single failure to compromise the entire system. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>What kinds of security activities can a security team undertake with a development team? What are the pros and cons of each? (ex: penetration testing, threat modeling, etc..)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Yeah I don't really know this one. 
          </li>

      <h3><b>Geometry of SOCP (Rotated Second Order Cones)</b></h3>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">November 19, 2018</span></h5>
      <script src='https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML' async></script>
      <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">

      });
      </script>
      <h4>Motivation</h4>
      Second Order Cone Programming is a powerful tool. This convex optimization problem has the form:
      $$\text{min}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} c^Tx \\ 
      \text{s.t. } \|A_ix+b_i\|_2 \leq c_i^Tx+d_i$$
      There are many optimization problems that can be reduced to this general form, but the punchline is, we now allow for constraints involving the norm of $x$, a step up from the linear constraints that we required in LPs, and QPs. But it is not obvious why SOCPs are more "general" than QCQPs, which have the form:
      $$\text{min}_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} x^TH_0x+2c_0^Tx+d_0 \\ 
      \text{s.t. } x^TH_ix+2c_i^Tx+d_i \leq 0 \\
      x^TH_jx+2c_j^Tx+d_j = 0$$
      Can't we just square the inequality constraint in our SOCP, such that it can be massaged into a QCQP? This is not the case, because in general, it is invalid to square constraints of the form $\|x\| \leq k$. So SOCP is at least as general as QCQP. 


      <h4>Terminology</h4>
      What is a cone? The definition of a cone is any set $\mathcal{S}$ that satisfies the property that $s \in \mathcal{S} \Rightarrow \alpha s \in \mathcal{S}, \alpha \geq 0$. There are all types of different cones that topologists love to study, but we will look at the "norm cone" with respect to a norm $\|*\|$:
      $$\mathcal{C}=\{(x,t), \|x\| \leq t\} \subseteq \mathcal{R}^{n+1}$$ 
      We mathematically define an $(n+1)$ dimensional Second Order Cone as follows:
      $$\mathcal{K}_n=\{(x,t),x \in \mathbb{R}^n, t \in \mathbb{R}: \|x\|_2 \leq t\}$$
      Here, we see the meaning of the name "Second Order" cone, as it is a norm cone using the $\mathcal{l}_2$ norm. Another equivalent definition of the $(n+1)$ second order cone is the intersection of an infinite number of half spaces:
      $$\mathcal{k}_n=\bigcap_{u:\|u\| \leq 1}\{(x,t), x \in \mathbb{R}^n, t \in \mathbb{R} : x^Tu \leq t\}$$



      <h4>Geometry</h4>
      We now introduce a constraint known as a hyperbolic constraint:
      $$\|x\|_2^2 \leq 2yz, y \geq 0, z \geq 0, \text{where: } x \in \mathbb{R}^n, y \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \mathbb{R}$$
      Then, we claim that this constraint is exactly equivalent to the Second Order Cone constraint:
      $$\|\begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y-z)
      \end{bmatrix}\|_2 \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y+z)$$
      which can be verified algebraically. What we have just done is converted hyperbolic constraints into SOC constraints. However, if we inspect the resulting SOC constraint, and reverse engineer it, we see that:
      $$\begin{bmatrix}
      I_n & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
      0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
      \end{bmatrix}
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      y \\
      x \\
      \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
      x \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y-z) \\
      \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(y+z)
      \end{bmatrix} 
      $$
      The matrix on the left is a rotation matrix in the $y,z$ plane of 45 degrees clockwise. Hyperbolic constraints are equivalent to a funny looking SOC constraint, which is equivalent to actually just an SOC, "toppled" to the ground, or formally speaking, rotated! And so this is where we get the notion of a rotated SOC. We start with an SOC, apply to it a rotation matrix, and realize that the result is equivalent to a hyperbolic constraint. How neat!

      <h3><b>A Lesson in Practicality</b></h3>
      <h5><span class="w3-opacity">November 7, 2018</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>"Strive for beauty and elegance." These were the words of my dad as he would teach me mathematics and physics, the former usually within the context of the latter, and for good measure he would somehow throw a Confucius quote in there. And so I naturally was drawn towards these fields during all of my formative years. Middle school, high school, my early college career. Days were filled with AP classes, where I would learn about derivatives, ellipses, and classical mechanics. When I went home, I eargerly phoned my dad, who I saw less and less as he was always travelling for work, and he would give me further insight, almost condescendingly explaining how the topics that I was studying are simplifications of more general theories, how classical physics is a simple derivative of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks. I would then do the problem sets assigned for homework, and work through the "Problem Solving" sections in my calculus book, anxious to go to math club the next day to share what I learned. I came into college, and took Math H54, honors linear algebra, and was left in the dust by the prodigies in that class. I took Physics 7B, as I intended to major in Physics, I became nauseated by the idea of taking another ring integral. 61A, computer science, was really the only class I enjoyed. So since that freshman year first semester, I have had to reformulate the "objective function" of my life. "The world runs on practicality and innovation, not Lagrange multipliers", my friend would always tell me. And so I figured it was time to become more practical. As my junior year rolled around, I was still extremely impractical, opting to sip on some coffee and read my Optimization textbook on a Sunday morning instead of applying for internships. So I started to panic, I needed to show employers that I wasn't just a high level abstractionist who can only type up problem sets in LaTex. So when Cal Hacks, a hack a thon organized by UC Berkeley, came around, I told myself that I was going to go and show employers that Ray can code. And wow that was 36 hours of suffering. Our team did win the best VR hack, and it was fun to learn about Unity3D/C#, but during the hack a thon there was always in the back of my mind "go study for your midterm". I once read a blog post by Andrej Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla, about undergraduate advice, and it went something along the lines of "The strongest students do just well enough in their classes to get around the 80% percentile, and spend the rest of their time exploring other technologies." And so here I am today, frantically applying to internships, getting rejected by near all of them. I still love to study what I love, but knowing how to adapt and be practical is perhaps even more important.</p>
